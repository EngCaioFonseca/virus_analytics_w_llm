# ðŸ§¬ Viral Genome Analysis Assistant

## Description
The Viral Genome Analysis Assistant is a powerful web application that combines advanced language models (LLaMA 3.2) with computational biology to analyze viral genomes. This tool helps researchers and biologists understand viral sequences, their structures, mutations, and potential characteristics through an intuitive interface.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Genome Sequence Upload**: Support for multiple file formats (FASTA, TXT, GenBank)
- **Interactive Analysis**: Multiple analysis types available simultaneously
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverages LLaMA 3.2 for advanced genomic interpretation
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback and analysis results

### Analysis Types
1. **Basic Genome Information**
   - Sequence composition
   - Length analysis
   - Basic structural features

2. **Protein Structure Analysis**
   - Protein coding regions
   - Structural predictions
   - Functional domains

3. **Mutation Analysis**
   - Variant identification
   - Mutation patterns
   - Potential impact assessment

4. **Phylogenetic Relationships**
   - Evolutionary connections
   - Related viral strains
   - Genetic lineage analysis

5. **Potential Variants**
   - Variant prediction
   - Mutation hotspots
   - Strain classification

6. **Drug Target Sites**
   - Potential therapeutic targets
   - Drug binding sites
   - Treatment implications

### Interactive Features
- **AI Assistant**: Built-in Q&A system for technical support and analysis interpretation
- **Sequence Preview**: Visual representation of uploaded sequences
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time analysis progress indicators
- **Chat History**: Persistent conversation tracking for reference

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

bash

pip install streamlit

pip install requests

pip install biopython

pip install pandas


### Local Setup
1. Install Ollama
2. Download and run the LLaMA 3.2 model:

bash
ollama run llama3.2

3. Run the application:

bash

streamlit run viral_genome_analysis.py


## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. Launch the application
2. Upload your viral genome sequence file
3. Select desired analysis types
4. Review results in real-time

### Using the AI Assistant
- Access the sidebar Q&A section for:
  - Technical questions
  - Analysis interpretation
  - Methodology explanations
  - General viral genomics queries

### Supported File Formats
- `.fasta` - FASTA format
